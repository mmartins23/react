# Getting Started
Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Quick Start
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.
