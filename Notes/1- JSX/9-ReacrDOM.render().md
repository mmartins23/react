# ReactDOM.render() II
Move to the right a little more, and you will see this expression:

```js
document.getElementById('app')
```

You just learned that ReactDOM.render() makes its first argument appear onscreen. But where on the screen should that first argument appear?

The first argument is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument.

In the code editor, select index.html. See if you can find an element that would be selected by document.getElementById('app').

That element acted as a container for ReactDOM.render()‘s first argument! At the end of the previous exercise, this appeared on the screen:

```js
<main id="app">
  <h1>Render me!</h1>
</main>
```

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Write code here:
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Render me!</h1>, document.getElementById('container'));
```

```html
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Write code here:
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Render me!</h1>, document.getElementById('container'));
```
